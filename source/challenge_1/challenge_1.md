## Challenge 1
The Raccoon Den is one of the best nightclubs in the city. Each night of the week, 
the owner lets 150 people into the club. No more, no less. Demand has become so great that the owner has decided to
reduce the line by letting people add their names to the list from a text message. 

Write a program that will take csv of club gowers ( "first_name, last_name, phone_number" ) and put them in a virtual line.
The first name that is received will be the first person that gets allowed in the doors, vereifed by their phone number. 
After the 150th person the system will send out a rejection message.
