## Challenge 2
At the parking lot across the street, the manager realizes that his employees spend a lot of their time trying to find 
what spot the cars are in. In order to save them the time she hires us to write an application that will keep track of the 150 spots. 

Create an application that will take a list of 23 cars, and park them in spots from the back of the lot to the front (First car in the lot is the last spot). 
Return the Car and Spot so it can be printed on tickets for the owner. At the end of the night the cars leave the lot in the opposite order they arrived.

* The first car to get parked will be the last car to leave the lot. Getting spot 1. 
* The last car to get parked will be the first car to leave the lot. Getting spot 20. 
* Use a hash {Car Name: "Aston Martin DB5", spot: 20 } to represent the car data
